# Converse symmetry breaking calculations

### Prerequisites
- able to run Matlab scripts from a given folder
- able to run Python 3 scripts from the same folder
- for the optional steps, able to run pdfLatex 

### Description

For all the scripts below, it is assumed that they are run with `<your_path>/csb_powergrid/CSB` as the current folder.
This repository includes the output of these scripts as .zip files. Re-running the scripts may take a few hours.

1) Run `RunAll2nodeClusters.m` to generate matrix P for all possible two-node clusters.
	OUT: `similarity_*.csv`, `EQ_*/P_%d_%d.dat`

2) Run `make_similarity_graphs.py` to visualize the input strength patterns for a selection of two-node clusters (chosen according to various measures of similarity).
	OUT: `cluster_choice_*.dat` files, `Results_*` folders containing similarity graphs (`graph_*_sim_%d_[%d,%d].png`)

3) Run `RunSelected2nodeClusters.m` to compute the 2D stability landscape as a function of the &beta;'s for a given choice of two-node cluster using the symmetrized P'.
	IN: `cluster_choice_%s.dat` OUT: `Results*/landscape_*_%d_%d.dat` and `Results*/landscape_args_*_%d_%d.dat`

4) Run `RunClusterZoominInterpolation.m` to compute the precise stability values as the systems are interpolated between
	original and exact-equitable.
	OUT: `Results*/interp2_beta_[opt/tilde]_%s_%d_%d.dat`, `Results*/interp2_lmax_%s_%d_%d.dat`

5) OPTIONAL: run `make_interpolation_plots.py` to plot the results from (4)

6) OPTIONAL: run `plot_landscapes.py` to plot the 2D stability landscapes from (3)

7) OPTIONAL: run `make_landscape_slides.py` to create a slideshow of all 2-node cluster similarities and landscapes.
	NOTE: this requires (5) and (6) to run before this one.
	OUT: `Landscape_choices.tex` â€” compile this with pdflatex to create the actual slideshow as Landscape_choices.pdf
	NOTE: if the tex file is empty, it means that the files from the previous steps were not found.

8) Run `make_pub_figure.py` to make the prototype of Fig. 4 in the paper. This script uses the other `make_pub*.py` files to plot each section.
	NOTE: The landscape plotting function in `make_pub_b.py` computes the landscapes and saves them to cache files (`plot_landscape_*.npz`).
	      These cache files speed up plotting the next time, since the landscapes take some time to compute. 
              If you want to force recomputation, just delete these .npz files.
