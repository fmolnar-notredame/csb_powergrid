Analysis shows that grid heterogeneity can enhance the stability of required homogeneous synchronous states.

### Abstract
Behavioral homogeneity is often critical in a system of interacting entities, such
as a power-grid network, whose stable operation requires all generators to
have homogeneous frequencies. Previous work suggests that the stability of
such dynamical homogeneity can be improved by making the parameters of
the interacting entities homogeneous. Here, we use power grids as representative
examples to show that a substantial additional improvement is possible by
instead making the parameters suitably heterogeneous. We develop a general
method to validate a major contribution to this effect from converse symmetry
breaking, in which the system must be asymmetric to maintain a stable
symmetric state. As the first demonstration of converse symmetry breaking in
real-world systems, our findings have wide implications for many other networks
whose functions depend on their dynamical homogeneity.
