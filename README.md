**Article title:** Asymmetry underlies stability in power grids

**Authors:** Ferenc Molnar, Takashi Nishikawa, Adilson E. Motter

**Abstract:**
Behavioral homogeneity is often critical for the functioning of network systems
of interacting entities. In power grids, whose stable operation requires
generator frequencies to be synchronized—and thus homogeneous—across the network, previous work
suggests that the stability of synchronous states can be improved
by making the generators homogeneous. Here, we show that a substantial additional
improvement is possible by instead making the generators suitably
heterogeneous. We develop a general method for attributing this counterintuitive
effect to converse symmetry breaking, a recently established phenomenon
in which the system must be asymmetric to maintain a stable symmetric state.
These findings constitute the first demonstration of converse symmetry breaking
in real-world systems, and our method promises to enable identification of
this phenomenon in other networks whose functions rely on behavioral
homogeneity.
